The completed application should meet the following criteria:

As a user, I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.

As a user, I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.<br>
Edited: Changed to a user friendly GUI instead of prompt windows

As a user, I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.

As a user, I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.

As a user, I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after each round.

### Specifications

Must use the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` methods to collect user input and display information to the user.<br>
Edited:  total wins, ties and losses are displayed full time

The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.
